# My Very First Website

Welcome to my first website! I am a junior software developer and a student studying at [Code Institute] (https://codeinstitute.net). Check out the link to see more about the Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer programme that I am undertaking as part of my studies at Code Institute.

Project Description
This site was created as a learner tool in order to get familiar with common development tools like Git, Gitpod and GitHub. Gitpod is an example of an integrated development environment (IDE) editor and it is used to create modifiable projects and also to preview and run code. The project also introduced the terminal and control line interface within Gitpod. 

Technology
This project was written in HTML & CSS using Gitpod and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
